# Job Matchmaker: AI-Driven Resume to Job Posting Matching

## Project Overview

Job Matchmaker is an innovative solution designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and their ideal job postings. Utilizing AI technologies, including Word2Vec and BERT models, this platform analyzes resumes and job descriptions to find the best matches based on semantic content similarity.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Extracts key information and skills from resumes using natural language processing techniques.

- **Job Description Analysis**: Processes job postings to understand required skills and qualifications, ensuring a thorough understanding of job requirements.

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques including Word2Vec and BERT models to match resumes with job postings based on semantic content similarity.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface for job seekers and recruiters to view matched results, manage profiles, and customize job search criteria.


## Technologies Used

- **[Word2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)**: For generating word embeddings from job descriptions and resumes, helping to understand the semantic similarity between words.

- **[BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html)**: Used for creating context-aware embeddings that capture the deeper semantic meanings of text.

- **[Cosine Similarity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html)**: Measures the similarity between the vectorized representations of resumes and job postings, determining the degree of alignment between job seeker qualifications and job requirements.

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: Primary programming language for backend development.

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**: For the frontend development, facilitating a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**: Utilized for designing the UI/UX of the web application, ensuring a modern and intuitive user interface.

- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**: For version control and source code management.

- **[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/)**: Used for extracting information from CVs.

- **[Netlify](https://openai.com/)**: For website deployment.
